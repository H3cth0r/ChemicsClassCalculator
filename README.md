# ChemicsClassCalculator
I creted this project for making easier my Chemistry class. It has different functions for calculating things like:
      - Electronegativity difference
      - Molar mass of a molecule
      - Retrieve general info of an element
      - Molecular geometry
      - Boyle Law calculator
      - Charles law calculator
      - Avogrado law calculator
      - Packing efficiency
      
  It made easier my chemistry class.
